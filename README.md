# QuickInstaller
A set of scripts used to quickly set up an outdated computer. Great for maschines that load a certain image on a reboot.

## Usage from zero
1. Download the repo (green button) or clone it with git
2. Run the "run.bat" as admin   
3. Watch as chocolatery installs and takes care of your apps   
4. Congrats, your pc is now set up with current software. To update it use cmd as admin and execute "choco upgrade all"   

## Filius 
For anyone using filius, this downloads and installs the JDK as well as downloads and runs the filius installer, also theres a basic template to get you started, since theres some stuff that you always use and its just annoying to set up.

## Edit what it installs
Modify the install-apps bat to your liking. You can look up packeges on the chocolatery website or with "choco find YOURSEARCHTERM".
